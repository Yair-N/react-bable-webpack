## Creating a folder structure
Now we will see how to maintain files in folders. This structure may be get vary according to you choice.  Iâ€™ll show you structure which I personally prefer. Choice is yours!  

1. Create a folder and name it as per your application name.  
2. Open folder in command prompt (cmd).  
3. Run the following command in cmd:  

``` console
npm init

```
1. This will ask you some basic information like package name, author name. description, and license. With   this info it will create a file called package.json  
2. Create a src folder inside your project folder and add empty files named as index.js and index.html and      create two config files at your project level called .babelrc and webpack.config.js
